A Flutter application designed for timing World Schools Debate.

## What is World Schools Debate?
According to the National Speech and Debate Association:

"World Schools Debate is a unique and dynamic form of debate, unlike any other practiced in the United States. World Schools Debate is a dynamic format combining “prepared” topics with “impromptu” topics, encouraging debaters to focus on specific issues rather than debate theory or procedural arguments. This highly interactive style of debate allows debaters to engage each other, even during speeches. This challenging format requires good teamwork and in-depth quality argumentation."

## What is Flutter?
According to Google:

"Flutter is Google’s mobile app SDK for crafting high-quality native interfaces on iOS and Android in record time. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source."

## What does this application do?
This simple application allows for easy timing of World Schools Debate rounds.  Especially for beginners, it can be difficult to start debating in this format due to the structure.  This app makes a notification sound when entering/exiting protected time.  Additionally, it makes a sound when in overtime.  It allows switching between the different speakers and makes the appropriate adjustments in timing.  The mute button on the top right silences the notification sounds.  This app is particularly great for judges to subtly notify competitors of the protected time periods.
